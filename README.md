# 🎯 Pat3on - Decentralized Subscription Platform

**Empowering Creators. Supporting Fans. Built on Blockchain.**

Pat3on is a Web3 subscription platform similar to Patreon, where creators can monetize their content through recurring subscriptions paid in cryptocurrency. Unlike traditional platforms, Pat3on gives both creators and subscribers more control, transparency, and ownership.

---

Pat3on connects content creators with their supporters through blockchain technology. Creators can offer subscription tiers, and fans can subscribe using cryptocurrency to access exclusive content and perks.

## 🎨 Key Features

### ✨ Automatic Recurring Payments
Once you subscribe, payments flow automatically every month - no need to manually approve transactions each time. This is powered by **Superfluid Protocol**, which enables real-time money streaming.

### 🔐 Custodial Wallets
Don't have a crypto wallet? No problem! Pat3on creates one for you automatically when you sign up. Your wallet is:
- Encrypted and stored securely
- Automatically funded with gas fees
- Easy to export if you want to use it elsewhere

### 📱 Creator Dashboard
Creators can:
- Create multiple subscription tiers (Basic, Premium, VIP, etc.)
- Set custom pricing for each tier
- View subscriber count and earnings
- Manage their content and perks

### 🎯 Subscription Tiers
Like Patreon's membership levels, creators can offer different tiers with varying benefits:
- **Basic** - $5/month - Access to exclusive posts
- **Premium** - $15/month - Early access + Discord role
- **VIP** - $50/month - One-on-one sessions + all benefits

## 🎓 Learn More

### What is Superfluid?
Superfluid is a protocol that enables **money streaming** - instead of monthly payments, money flows continuously second-by-second. This means:
- No need to approve transactions each month
- Creators receive money in real-time
- Subscribers can cancel anytime, stopping the stream instantly
- Much lower gas fees (you only pay once to start the stream)

### What is a Testnet?
We're currently running on **Sepolia testnet**, which is like a practice version of Ethereum. It uses fake money (test ETH and test USDC) so developers can test without risking real money. When Pat3on launches publicly, it will move to mainnet with real cryptocurrency.

### What is Gas?
"Gas" is the fee you pay for transactions on Ethereum. Think of it like postage stamps - you need a small amount to send transactions. Pat3on automatically gives new users a tiny amount of ETH (0.001) to cover their first few transactions.

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### Your Wallet, Your Keys
When Pat3on creates a wallet for you, we show you the private key **once** during signup. This key is like a password to your crypto wallet. We encrypt it and store it securely, but you should also write it down and keep it safe as a backup.

### What We Store
- Your email and encrypted password
- Your wallet address (public, like an account number)
- Your encrypted private key
- Your subscription preferences

### What We Don't Store
- Your plaintext password
- Your plaintext private key
- Your credit card information (we don't use credit cards!)

### Open Source
Pat3on's code is transparent and auditable. All smart contracts are verified on Etherscan, meaning anyone can see how the subscription system works.

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

### For Subscribers
- **Subscription Fee** - Set by creator (e.g., $10/month)
- **Initial Gas Fee** - ~$2 one-time to start subscription (we cover your first 0.001 ETH!)
- **Total Monthly Cost** - Just the subscription fee after initial setup

### For Creators
- **Platform Fee** - To be determined (much lower than Patreon's 8-12%)
- **Gas Costs** - Minimal due to Superfluid streaming
- **Withdrawal Fees** - Standard Ethereum gas fees

### Platform Economics
Pat3on aims to minimize platform fees by leveraging blockchain technology, reducing the need for traditional payment processors and intermediaries. This means more money goes directly to creators.
