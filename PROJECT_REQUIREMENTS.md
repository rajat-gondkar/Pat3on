1. Start with **Phase 1** (Project Setup)
2. Build **Phase 2** (Backend & Database) - foundational
3. Develop **Phase 3** (Smart Contracts) in parallel if possible
4. Build **Phase 4** (Frontend) once backend APIs are ready
5. Integrate everything in **Phase 5**
6. Deploy in **Phase 6**
7. Document in **Phase 7**

**Note**: This is an ambitious full-stack project. Take it step by step, test frequently, and don't hesitate to adjust the plan as needed. Good luck! üéâ
